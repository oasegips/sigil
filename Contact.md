# Getting help #

First off, have you read the InstallationInstructions? The [manual](http://web.sigil.googlecode.com/git/index.html)? Especially the [FAQ](http://web.sigil.googlecode.com/git/files/OEBPS/Text/faq.html)? Please do so. Chances are that your question/problem has already been covered. If it's not, then read on.

There's a [forum on MobileRead](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=203) dedicated to Sigil-related discussions. **This is the place to ask for help when all else fails.** There are plenty of knowledgeable people there who will be more than happy to help you, as long as you're polite. The Sigil developers frequently post there too.

Please search the forum before you post. There's a high chance your question has been answered already.
